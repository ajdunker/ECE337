What is the minimum amount of time that data_ready must remain asserted to ensure correct operation? 

5 clock cycles.

What is the minimum amount of time, in clock cycles, that data must remain valid after data_ready is asserted in order to ensure correct operation?

7 clock cycles.

How are the image files different? Does this make sense given the filter design built in the lab?

The filtered images only contain the data around the edges, this makes sense as this is where there is the most difference and in our lab we built a 4 sample average.

What is the general syntax for each of the file IO functions used in the provided test bench (tb_fir_filter_image.sv)?

It functions the same as stdio routines. You can prototype this code in C then convert it to Verilog.

//open file
integer file;
file = $fopenr("filename");

//End of file test
reg eof;
eof = $feof(file);

//Read formatted text
integer count;
count = $fscanf(file, format, args);
count = $sscanf(string, format, args);

//close file
r = $fcloser(file);

What are the different format specifiers available for use in file functions like $fscanf(?)?

b -- Binary values, d -- decimal values, o - octal values, h or x -- hexadecimal values, c -- single character, f -- floating point
